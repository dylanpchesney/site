        <p>Hello Christina and most likely whoever she told about this website! Thank you for your constant support. This site was primarily a reason for me to learn how to develop a website from scratch. It continues to be my playground alongside giving you some insight into who I am.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I’m a passionate people person with deep experience in revenue operations and customer success. 
              I started my career managing loan officers in the mortgage industry, then transitioned to building SDR teams for tech start ups, leading into the world of sales enablement, rev ops, and customer success that I live in today. My main focus today is helping build the best product possible by maintaining the highest level of communication with my customers.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of work you'll find me exploring NYC with my fiancée, rooting for the Eagles, preparing time-consuming meals, riding my bike, and exploring creative hobbys like forcing ChatGPT to help me code this website.</p>
